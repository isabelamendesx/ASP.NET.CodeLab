# ASP.NET Code Lab 🌐 📚💻

Welcome to ASP.NET CodeLab, my personal repository of web development studies! I initiated this project in January 2024, during my third year of college and while participating in the DiverseDev course at AdaTech. Here, you'll find a collection of projects and experiments that reflect my journey of growth and exploration in the dynamic world of web development.

## Options API 🚦

The primary goal of OptionsAPI is to demonstrate the seamless integration of configuration options to dynamically adjust the behavior of the ShoppingCartController. In particular, it exemplifies how a seasonal discount can be applied or removed based on the configuration settings.

#### 🌐 API Endpoints

- GET /ShoppingCart: Retrieve information about items in the shopping cart, with the option to apply or remove seasonal discounts. Perfect for exploring the dynamic behavior influenced by configuration settings.

## Purple Pizza API 🍕🟣

Purple Pizza API was the first API I buildt entirely on my own. The primary goal here was to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing a pizza inventory. It was a super fun project that provided me with a wealth of learning opportunities.

#### 🌐 API Endpoints

- GET /PurplePizza: Fetch a list of all pizzas, making pizza discovery a delightful experience.

- GET /PurplePizza/{id}: Explore the details of a specific pizza by providing its unique identifier.

- POST /PurplePizza: Contribute to the pizza collection by introducing a new, mouth-watering creation.

- PUT /PurplePizza/{id}: Keep the pizza menu fresh by updating the details of an existing pizza.

- DELETE /PurplePizza/{id}: Bid a fond farewell to a pizza that has served its purpose.
